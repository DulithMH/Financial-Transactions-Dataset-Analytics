### 3. How to Save Your Model (Optional but Professional)
In your Colab notebook, run this code at the very end to save your "Brain" (the model) to a file. You can then upload this file to the `models/` folder.

```python
import joblib

# Save the model to a file
joblib.dump(model, 'fraud_detection_rf_model.pkl')

print("Model saved successfully!")
